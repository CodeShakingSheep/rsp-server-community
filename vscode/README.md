This extension depends on VSCode RSP UI Extension which is going to be installed automatically along with VSCode Community Server Connector Extension. RSP UI in conjuction with Community Server Connector Extension supports a number of commands for interacting with supported server adapters; these are accessible via the command menu (`Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS or `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows and Linux) and may be bound to keys in the normal way.
